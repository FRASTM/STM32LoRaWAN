# STM32LoRaWAN library

This library provides support for LoRaWAN communication using the
STM32WL55 microcontroller (with embedded LoRa radio) inside the Arduino
develop environment (together with the [stm32duino
core](https://github.com/stm32duino/Arduino_Core_STM32).

This library offers an API that is highly similar to the API offered by
the [Arduino MKRWAN
library](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/mkrwan/)
(including undocumented methods) so any sketches written for either
library should usually work on the other too (but note below for some
caveats).
